Chest Tracker Release Alpha
==
Keeps a client-side cache of chests you've opened in the past (their coords and contents). Offers a method to search through and highlight all chests which contain an item of choice. 

Included Modules <3>:
---------------------
utils.py | Adds two classes, FakeEvent and EventWrapper. ! MEANT TO BE IMPORTED
   > EventWrapper allows referencing event.getString('<int>') with utils.EventWrapper(event)[<int>], as well as providing iter() and len(). 
   > FakeEvent creates a class with a .getString(<id>) attribute, completely created in order to enable testing EventWrapper without being 
     ingame. 
--
ctLib.py | Adds one class, StorageBlock, and two functions, name_to_id() and make_safe(). ! MEANT TO BE IMPORTED
   > StorageBlock is a class that contains the data and position for a storage block, like a chest. Currently is very basic. Can be cast to 
     dict. 
   > name_to_id() converts the name of an item (i.e. 'quartz') into the ID (i.e. 'minecraft:quartz'). If string is already an ID, returns it.
   > make_safe() converts the address of a server from World to a safe filename to store the world's data in. DOES NOT SUPPORT DIMENSIONS 
     YET. 
--
utilsTriggerScreen.py | Allows the calling of scripts with the prefix '.' <scriptname> to run u_<scriptname>.<js, py>. ! ADD TO SEND MESSAGE EVENT
   > any params that are passed after the first term are parsed to a list, and passed to a param JsMacro custom event. 
   > this event is configured such that when wrapped with utils.EventWrapper() params can be accessed through indexing, starting with [0] for 
     the first parameter. 

Included Scripts <2>: # NOTE: any file starting with 'u_' is counted by me as a script, since it is run using utilsTriggerScreen.py.
---------------------
u_findItem.py | Allows the searching of all cached chests, and highlights chests with a match. 
 >>> .findItem minecraft:quartz
 >>> .findItem oak_planks
--
u_testChestItem.py | Automatically caches opened chests. Overwrites old cache when chest reopened. ! ADD TO OPEN SCREEN EVENT
 >>> Known Issues: 
   - Opening a block that does not have a persistent inventory prints an error to chat. 
   - Does not work properly when the target chest is a double chest, logging up to two copies of every double chest item. This doesn't affect 
     u_findItem.py, as .findItem <item> only looks for the prescense of an item, not the count, but this will be fixed before implementing 
     anything needing the number of items.
